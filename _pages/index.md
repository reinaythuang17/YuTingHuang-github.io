**Welcome to Reina's world!**

Hi, this is Yu-Ting Huang (Reina), a Ph.D. student in economics. My primary research interests are health, public, labor, personnel and digital economics. I’m passionate about areas including health outcomes, internet and new technology, human capital, workplace dynamics, and the intersection between public policy and health.

One of my favorite quotes from The Little Prince is, “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.” It reminds me of the value of focus, patience, and commitment—both in research and in life. Outside of research, I love traveling and finding joy in the little details of everyday life. These experiences often inspire new perspectives in my work and keep me grounded and curious.
